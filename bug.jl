```julia
function myfunction(x)
  if x > 0
    return x^2
  else
    return -x^2
  end
  #The error is here, the function does not return anything if x == 0
  #This will cause an error if the function is called with x = 0
  #Also, it's better to use the ternary operator to make the code more concise
  #return x > 0 ? x^2 : -x^2
  #Alternatively, use the abs function to avoid the if-else statement
  #return -abs(x)^2
 end
```
